                       <ul>
                           <li><strong>She is Perfect</strong> - She was too good for this world so God took her immediately
                               to be with Him.</li>
                           <li><strong>Hope of the Resurrection</strong> - Even though my wife and I already knew about and
                               had faith in Jesus Christ and his victory over death, knowing that Sarah is waiting for us
                               gives us incredible hope.</li>
                           <li><strong>She is Ours for Eternity</strong> - Because Sarah was born in the covenant by virtue
                               of my wife and I having been sealed in the temple by restored priesthood authority, she will
                               be with us for time and all eternity. We are separated now but it is only a see you later.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <blockquote>
                           <p>"I am one of his witnesses, and in a coming day I shall feel the nail marks in his hands and
                               in his feet and shall wet his feet with my tears."</p>
                           <p>"But I shall not know any better then than I know now that he is God's Almighty Son, that he
                               is our Savior and Redeemer, and that salvation comes in and through his atoning blood and
                               in no other way."</p>
